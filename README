# NETSIM: A Network Simulator

NETSIM is a network simulator framework written in Python 3 and based on the
[NetworkX](http://networkx.readthedocs.org/) and [SimPy](http://simpy.readthedocs.org) package.

### Introduction
NETSIM is built on top of NetworkX and SimPy. Its architecture is inspired by the
[nxsim](https://github.com/kentwait/nxsim/) project, which is in turn a Python 3 port and update of
[ComplexNetworkSim](https://github.com/jschaul/ComplexNetworkSim). Thanks to the authors of both
packages for their work.

#### Who should use NETSIM?
If you want to do simple simulations using NetworkX based graph objects.
