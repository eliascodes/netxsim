# NETSIM: A Network Simulator

NETSIM is a network simulator framework written in Python 3 and based on the
[NetworkX](http://networkx.readthedocs.org/) and [SimPy](http://simpy.readthedocs.org) package.

## Introduction
NETSIM is built on top of NetworkX and SimPy. Its architecture is inspired by the
[nxsim](https://github.com/kentwait/nxsim/) project, which is in turn a Python 3 port and update of
[ComplexNetworkSim](https://github.com/jschaul/ComplexNetworkSim). Thanks to the authors of both
packages for their work.

## Status
Work in progress. See issues.


## TODOs
1. Add decent visualisation options:
  * using NetworkX's native visualisation functions
  * using pandas timeseries submodule
2. Add some example simulations:
  * Simple epidemiological simulation (one-shot)
  * Simple epidemiological simulation (monte-carlo)
  * More complex social network simulation (monte-carlo)
3. More tests
